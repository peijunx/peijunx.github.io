I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in [Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering (ISE)](https://ise.illinois.edu/) of [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/).  <br>

I obtained my bachelor's degrees in General Mathematics from [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2017. <br>

My current research focuses on: <br>
- **Machine Learning**: Neural network pruning and architecture search; Semi-supervised learning
networks; Ads automated bidding strategies; <br>
- **Optimization**: Distributed optimization with low communication budget; Nonconvex optimization in min-max and bilevel settings; Efficient algorithms in solving linearly constrained problems.
